# Introduction to Machine Learning - Workshop
In this workshop you will learn how to use the sklearn package to build, train, and evaluate machine learning models.



## What You Will Learn
* What is Machine Learning?
* How to select an algorithm that best fits your dataset and desired outcome.
* Explore popular real-world algorithms such as Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and etc...
* Understand the importance of hyperparameters and tuning them to get the best results.
* Understand the importance of regularization and how to use it to prevent overfitting.
* Discover different approaches to solve machine learning classification and regression problems.
* Develop Machine Learning Models using the sklearn package.
* Understand the importance of data preprocessing and how to use it to improve your model's performance.
