# The AI DOJO Machine Learning Workshops

This is the repository for The Machine Learning Workshops, published by [AI DOJO](https://github.com/TheAIDojo). It contains all the workshops code with supporting project files necessary to work through the code.

## Requirements and Setup

We recommend to use [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/?utm_source=scs-index), you will fond Colab icon in the top of all AI DOJO code.
If you are want to use your own pc place follow the instructions below:
1. Install Python on [Windows/Mac](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-387/).
2. Install pip for [Windows/Mac/Linux](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/).
3. Make sure to install the necessary python packages for the workshop from the [requirements.txt](https://github.com/TheAIDojo/Workshops/blob/main/requirements.txt) file.
4. Donwload the code editer we are recommend [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

## About The AI DOJO Machine Learning Workshop

With expert guidance and real-world examples the AI DOJO Machine Learning Workshop will walk you through the process of building, training, and model evaluation of your machine learning and Deep Learning algorithms. By showing you how to leverage TensorFlow flexibility, The AI DOJO Machine Learning Workshop will teach you all the skills you need to use machine learning & Deep Learning in the right way.
